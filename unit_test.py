Unit tests for introducing

Type_1: Is the form to test the individual form elements or font code.

Don't have a relation with the python.

To create a new unit test is necessary, create a new class.

   Method                       Check

assertEqual                     a == b
assertNotEqual                  a != b
asserTrue(x)                    x is true
asserFalse(x)                   x is false
assertIs(a, b)                  a is b
assertIsNot(a, b)               a is not b
assertIsNone(x)                 x is None
assertIsNotNone(x)              x is not None
assertIn(a, b)                  a is in b
assertNotIn(a, b)               a is not in b
asserIsInstance(a, b)           a is instance of b
assertNotIsInstance(a, b)       a is not instance of b
----------------------------------------------------------------

To convention, all tests should initialize with test_[name of the function].

To execute tests in the terminal: python3 module_name.py

Another form -> verbose mode: python3 module_name.py -v
